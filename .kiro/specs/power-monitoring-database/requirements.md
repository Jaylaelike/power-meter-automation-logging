# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a SQLite database with time series functionality to store and manage power monitoring data from multiple stations. The system currently collects real-time power consumption data from stations via WebSocket connections and logs it to files. We need to implement a persistent database solution using Prisma ORM to store this time series data efficiently, enabling historical data analysis, querying, and reporting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store power monitoring data in a SQLite database, so that I can persist historical data and perform efficient queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the monitoring system receives power data THEN the system SHALL store the data in a SQLite database
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use Prisma ORM as the database interface
3. WHEN the database is created THEN the system SHALL support time series data storage patterns
4. IF the database file does not exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to store structured power consumption readings with timestamps, so that I can analyze power usage trends over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN power data is received THEN the system SHALL store station name, timestamp, and all power readings
2. WHEN storing Active Power readings THEN the system SHALL store values for Power 1-6 with units in Watts
3. WHEN storing MUX Power Meter readings THEN the system SHALL store values for MUX#1-4 with units in kWh
4. WHEN storing timestamps THEN the system SHALL use ISO 8601 format with timezone information
5. WHEN storing readings THEN the system SHALL maintain data type integrity (numeric values as numbers)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a monitoring system operator, I want to query historical power data by station and time range, so that I can generate reports and analyze consumption patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL support filtering by station name
2. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date/time ranges
3. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL support ordering by timestamp
4. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL return results in a structured format
5. WHEN performing queries THEN the system SHALL use indexed fields for optimal performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want to migrate existing log data to the database, so that I can preserve historical monitoring information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating log data THEN the system SHALL parse existing monitor.log files
2. WHEN parsing log entries THEN the system SHALL extract station names, timestamps, and power readings
3. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL handle duplicate entries gracefully
4. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of imported records
5. IF log parsing fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other entries and log errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to be version controlled and manageable, so that I can track changes and deploy updates safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL use Prisma migrations for schema management
2. WHEN the schema changes THEN the system SHALL generate migration files automatically
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL apply pending migrations automatically
4. WHEN running migrations THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity
5. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and report errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor database performance and storage usage, so that I can ensure optimal system operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing large amounts of data THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable write performance
2. WHEN querying historical data THEN the system SHALL return results within reasonable time limits
3. WHEN the database grows THEN the system SHALL support data archival or cleanup strategies
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide query execution statistics
5. IF storage space becomes limited THEN the system SHALL provide warnings and cleanup options
